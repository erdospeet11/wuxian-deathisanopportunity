## Map:
- it is like a forest map with mountains
- there are different pois where the cult members are
- fight them learn their weakness
- die -> overcome that

For example one uses poison. if you suffer a lot of poison and it meets a threshold you get a poison card that you can infuse into your soul, making you invulnerable

## Art style: 
- 3d with small scope
- blocky environment
- character
	- lowpoly, minimalistic
	- few animations
